### Question 1

"values added:  20"

### Question 2

"values added:  20"

### Question 3

"values added:  20"

### Question 4

Because `result` was defined with the `let` keyword the variabel result had a scope limited to the if statement, and not out of it, where it was called.

### Question 5

Again there was an error. This time it also explicitly states the error was in 'result = numl + num2' which is wrong because it is trying to assing a value to a constant, which is a variable not meant to change or be modified at all.

### Question 6

Here there is an another error but not because the value can not be modified, but instead because of the scope of `result` is limited and can not be accessed from here.
